# This Is Arduino!
## Introduction
Arduino is an opensource convenient,flexible and easy-to-use electronic platform,including hardware(various types of Arduino boards) and software (Arduino IDE).
  
## Advantages
* Cross-Platform  
You can run Arduino IDE on three major operating systems,Windows„ÄÅMac OS and Linux.
* Easy
It's really easy!
## Common boards
* Arduino Nano

* Arduino Mega  
  I don't think you will use it and  if so,just google!  

## How to Interpret these images?
As you see,these images all has a legend,which is colorful.And each color represents a protocol,just like brown stands for digital pin and violet stands for the pin can be used as analog pin.  
  
What is digital and what is analog?We will learn it later and you just need to know digital is just 0 and 1;analog is a nubmer between 0 and 255 or more.
