# Motor Control
Typically , we only control **DC motor** in our projects, sometimes we may use **stepper motor**.

Thus, in this chapter, we will learn how to control DC motor only.
# 1. Most used Motor Drivers
## 1.1 Purpose:
Actually , we use motor drivers for three reasons:
- **Supply power to motors**
- **Control motor direction**
- **Control motor speed**
## 1.2 Motor drivers:
Due to MCU IOs are limited , thus we need motor drivers to finish these jobs.
There are two widely used motor drivers which are L298N and TB6612.
**L298N:**

**TB6612:**

Though they are different motor drivers , general purpose is same.

So , we will only take L298N as an example , you can look up for yourself for other motor drivers.
