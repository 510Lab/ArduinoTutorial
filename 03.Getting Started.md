# Well,Let's getting started!   
In this charpter,you will konck on the door of Arduino world for the first time.    
You will install your Arduino IED and firstly light your own LED.   
    
    
## 1.Install Arduino IED.
If you are in Windows,just click [here](https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-nightly-windows.zip).    
    
And for Linux,you can use <kbd>snap</kbd> commond in terminal:
```
sudo snap install arduino
```     
Is it easy?Using Linux right now!  

Getting a word in edgewise,someone need software for Mac OS?    
    
Alright? Move on!

## 2.Lighting your first LED!
<img src="https://github.com/510Lab/ArduinoTutorial/blob/main/pics/demoPics/3-1.jpg" alt="3-1 LED接线" width="200%"/>   
Attach the positive electrode of led to pin 2 like picture above and type the code below in your Arduino IED.   
  
By the way,do you konw why a resistance is added?  
  
Reminiscent of high school knowledge,adding a resistance can reduce current and voltage.  
  
Normal LED just need 2V votage and above 35mA current,so a 100Ω and above resistance is necessary.  
  
  
```C++
int LEDPin = 2;

void setup(){
pinMode(LEDPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop(){
digitalWrite(LEDPin, HIGH);
delay(1000);
digitalWrite(LEDPin, LOW);
delay(1000);
}
```
OK,I think it's easy and you all done.  
So,you can put it into practice.  
Imaging that you are on a desert island，you will send out the SOS signal with led，now do it！
